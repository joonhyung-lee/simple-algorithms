### Essential Algorithms

- DFS / BFS Based Searching
  - Basic graph traversal techniques used in connected component search, shortest path in unweighted graphs, and backtracking.

- Dijkstra’s Algorithm
  - Efficient shortest path algorithm using a priority queue (no negative weights allowed).

- Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)
  - Kruskal’s Algorithm: Greedy approach using sorted edges and Union-Find structure.
  - Prim’s Algorithm: Greedy approach using a priority queue and adjacency list.

- Floyd-Warshall Algorithm
  - All-pairs shortest path computation using dynamic programming. Suitable for dense graphs with small N.

- Prefix Sum Algorithm
  - Used to compute range sums in O(1) time after O(n) preprocessing.

- Binary Search Algorithm
  - Efficient search in sorted sequences. Learn both inclusive and exclusive versions, and how to handle duplicates using bisect_left / bisect_right.

- Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) / Least Common Multiple (LCM)
  - Core number-theoretic operations using Euclidean algorithm.

- Tree Traversal
  - DFS-based recursive traversal using adjacency list; used for LCA, subtree size computation, DP on trees, etc.
